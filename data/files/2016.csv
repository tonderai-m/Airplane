The PC ,while flying at night, one Inertial Reference Unit failed and suddenly the instruments for the pilot flying showed the plane pitching steeply up, which he tried to correct.  Due to the plane's unusual attitude, the instruments went into a ""declutter"" mode, which among other things removed the indication that the two pilots' instruments were conflicting."

Among the errors made which caused the crash were the decisions to let the plane take off without enough fuel to make the flight safely and then to not stop midway to refuel. The pilot also did not report the plane's emergency until it was too late. In addition, as the fuel was running out, they extended the flaps and gear just before the engines stopped, but this caused enough drag that they could no longer glide to the airport. Since the captain was part owner of the small airline, he was motivated to cut fuel costs because the company was in financial trouble."
