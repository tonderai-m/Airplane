However, it was soon evident that the tail rotor could not balance the increased power created by the main rotor. Under certain conditions the aircraft would become unstable and lose directional heading. Sikorsky warns of these conditions. To compensate for the mistake that had been made, Sikorsky designed and tested a bell crank system to stabilize the rear rotor. After seven years, this helicopter was still not retrofitted with the bell crank system. Gross weight of the container exceeded the lifting capacity of the helicopter.

Then a sudden tail wind increases the speed to 155 kt. Cross winds from several directions made the plane unstable. Tail winds alternated with frontal winds making the speed unstable. The plane only hit the runway after 800m. The same cross winds make it impossible to align to the center of the runway. Then aquaplaning did the rest."
