Pena Blanca while en route. The pilot's attempt to fly over mountainous terrain by visual reference to the ground under weather conditions restricting visibility which forced him to descend to a dangerously low altitude.

Holston, Tennessee",Southeast Airlines,308,Nashville - Knoxville - Tri-City Aport,Douglas DC-3,N18941,2007,10   (passengers:7  crew:3),10   (passengers:7  crew:3),0,"The aircraft struck the slope of Mt Holston, located 15 miles from the airport during an ILS approach to Tri-City Airport. Pilot's failure to identify an intersection properly, resulting in flying 15 miles beyond the outer marker and descending to an alititude too low to clear high terrain. An inoperative compass was not entered into the aircraft log."

As the plane descended over Guanabara Bay in rain, the extended nosewheel struck the water. The crew tried to continue the approach, but the aircraft crashed near Flecheiras Beach, short of the runway. The actual cause of the accident was never determined however, the most probable cause was pilot error in descending below the minimum altitude on final approach. Aircrew fatigue was considered to be a contributing factor.  Crew flight time exceeded the Brazilian limits, but did not exceed the German limitations."

It appeared, the pilot became disoriented and flew the plane into the ground.  Officially: The pilot's decision to undertake a flight in which the likelihood of encountering IFR conditions existed, when he was not certified to fly IFR. Also, deficiencies in the weather briefing and the pilot's unfamiliarity with the instrument which determines the attitude of the aircraft. In later years, a story appeared in the Iowa Globe Gazette in which a pilot, Al Potter, flying in the vicinity of the aircraft that night, claimed he was in contact with the aircraft shortly before it crashed.

The aircraft struck the water while in shallow descent at 150 mph with its landing gear and flaps extended. Primarily the crash resulted from the failure of the crew to properly monitor essential instruments for determining attitude due to preoccupation with particular aspects of the aircraft and its environment. Limited experience of the crew with this particular type of aircraft. Erroneous setting of the captain's altimeter. Possibly misinterpretation of the altimeter and rate of descent indicator."

When the aircraft reached the tops of trees its wings were nearly level and its nose was raised in a climbing attitude but the descent continued and the plane crashed one quarter of a mile southeast of the airport.
