Also contributing to the accident were the air traffic controller's issuance of an ambiguous clearance to the flight crew, which resulted in the airplane's premature descent, his failure to address the pilot's incorrect read back of the assigned clearance altitudes, and his failure to monitor the flight and address the altitude violations and issue terrain-based safety alerts."

One passenger was run over by one of the emergency vehicles. The crew's failure to monitor and maintain the plane's airspeed, and its failure to abort the landing when in trouble.
