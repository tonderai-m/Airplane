The crew made an emergency landing in the Bengawan Solo River, in shallow water. The plane circled several times before diving in a steep course towards the river. The plane's left wing struck a river bank before it plunged into the water. The reason the crew flew into extreme weather was the heavy rain and hail was shadowed on the radar and blocked from radar view. In addition, the airplane had a partially failed battery which was exhausted by two attempts to restart the engines, producing a total electrical failure. A flight attendant drowned in the shallow water when she jumped from the plane."

Nevado de Cumbal volcano, in the Andes mountains, near the Ecuador / Colombian border. Air traffic control lost contact with the plane as it circled into Colombian territory to maneuver around snow capped mountain peaks and return to the Ecuadorian border city of Tulcán. The pilot's decision to initiate and continue the flight towards Tulcán Airport while below minimum meteorological conditions established in the company's standard operating procedure.  Inadequate navigation and operation of the aircraft by the pilot in command consistent with entering the holding pattern at the Tulcán NDB with a velocity of 230 knots indicated and with a bank angle of 15 degrees, exceeding the maximum limit of 180 knots stipulated throughout the procedure, and using a bank angle inferior to the recommended 25 to 30 degrees, thereby departing holding pattern obstacle protection, leading to a collision against the Cumbal Volcano."

The plane bounced three times before hitting the ground and exploding. More than 1,000 trees were uprooted by the impact. The plane was off course when the crew turned on final.

The flight crew exercised poor crew resource management and lost situational awareness during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to fly outside of the circling approach area, delaying the base turn, contrary to the captain’s intention to make a timely base turn. The flight crew did not execute a missed approach when they lost sight of the runway during the circling approach to runway 18R, which led them to strike high terrain (mountain) near the airport. When the first officer advised the captain to ascend again for landing, about 5 seconds before impact, the captain did not react, nor did the first officer initiate the missed approach himself."

Debris was spread across a 20 mile radius. Fifty-two children on a beach holiday were among the 69 aboard the Tupolev. The Tupolev pilot received contradictory instructions. The collision avoidance warning system (TCAS) told the pilot to ascend followed by an order from the Swiss air traffic controller to descend one second later. The Russian plane did not immediately respond to the tower's order to descend, so he repeated the command 14 seconds later. Thirty seconds later the two planes collided. The Tupolev's TCAS was telling the pilots to ascend. The Boeing's TCAS was telling the pilots to descend. The Swiss air traffic controller was telling the Tupolev's pilots to descend. The air traffic controller that guided the planes had no way of knowing the Russian pilot was receiving contradictory instruction from his cockpit TCAS unless told so by the pilot. Russian aviation officials said the pilot correctly gave precedence to the control tower, but Western aviation experts said pilots are trained to give precedence to the cockpit warning. In addition, the controller was left alone on duty while his partner went on a break and was preoccupied with another aircraft. This was accepted policy at Skyguide, the Swiss air control company. In addition, maintenance crews, working on the computer system, limited the controller's information he was receiving including conflict alert warnings. Sadly, one-and-a-half years later, the controller, Peter Nielsen, was stabbed to death by a Russian man who had lost his wife and two children in the accident."
