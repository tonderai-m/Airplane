Full power was applied to the engines in an attempt to pull up but other trees were struck and the pilot lost control. The aircraft crashed to the ground at a point approximately one-fourth of a mile southwest of the airport boundary.

The failure of the captain in charge of the flight to exercise the proper degree of fare by not checking his altimeters to determine whether both were correctly set and properly functioning before commencing his landing approach.

The crew began to descend, circling to the right and apparently banked normally for the radius and speed of the turns. After completing four circles, the plane recovered from the spiral in close proximity to the ground, went up to an altitude of about 200 to 500 feet and then pitched down and crashed in an open field. There was no fire in the plane prior to impact. No evidence of sabotage was discovered. There was no power plant failure prior to the accident, and the engines were functioning normally at the time the plane struck the ground. Nothing was found to indicate that there had been any structural failure or failure of the control system of the plane. As a result of the complete destruction of some portions of the plane, it was impossible to eliminate the possibility that such failure occurred. The probable cause of the accident was listed by the CAB as undetermined."
