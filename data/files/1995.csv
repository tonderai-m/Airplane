However, the aircraft was never brought to a stop and it continued  on overrunning the runway and crashing down a steep slope. Failure of the crew to follow the correct procedure to continue with the rejection of the take-off once that action had been initiated. Lack of crew coordination, insufficient emphasis on emergency training, inadequate enforcement of the requirements of the operations manual and a lack of supervision during loading preparation."

On the second takeoff the tail struck the ground and crashed back to the ground. The loss of directional control by the pilot in command during the takeoff roll, and his decision to continue the takeoff and initiate a rotation below the computed rotation airspeed, resulting in a premature lift-off, further loss of control and collision with the terrain. The flight crew's lack of understanding of the three-engine takeoff procedures, and their decision to modify those procedures. The failure of the company to ensure that the flight crew had adequate experience, training, and rest to conduct the nonroutine flight. Contributing to the accident was the inadequacy of Federal Aviation Administration oversight of Air Transport International and Federal Aviation Administration flight and duty time regulations that permitted a substantially reduced flight crew rest period when conducting a nonrevenue ferry flight under 14 Code of Federal Regulations Part 91."

The right engine throttle remained at takeoff thrust, while the left engine throttle slowly reduced to idle. The increasing thrust asymmetry resulted in an increasing left bank angle, which eventually reached about 170 degrees. The airplane lost altitude and impacted the ground. Lack of crew response to an extreme nose-down attitude. The investigation concluded that the captain was incapacitated. Just before impact the first officer expressed his concern about the situation of either the captain's incapacitation or the aircraft's attitude and attempted a recovery. The malfunctioning autothrottle was a recurring problem with this airplane that maintenance had been unable to fix because they could not duplicate Pilots were instructed to keep a hand on the throttle to stop it from happening however, this didn't happen because the captain was incapacitated."
"April 23, 1995",1240,"Lagos, Nigeria",Bristow Helicopters,?,Port Harcourt - Lagos,de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter 300,5N-AJQ,607,9   (passengers:7  crew:2),1   (passengers:0  crew:1),0,The aircraft experienced a micoburst while attempting to land at Lagos landing hard on the nosegear.

Neither flight crew saw the other aircraft in time to avoid the collision. The Piper crashed into a  wooded area and the Swearing into Lake Seul. Contributing to the occurrence were the inherent limitations of the see-and-avoid concept which preclude the effective separation of aircraft with high closure rates, the fact that neither crew was directly alerted to the presence of the other aircraft by the Flight Service specialist or by onboard electronic equipment and an apparent lack of pilot understanding of how to optimize avoidance maneuvering."

The crew had difficulty controlling the aircraft in turbulent conditions and the plane went into a spiral dive and crashed into a field. One or possibly both of the aircraft's artificial horizons malfunctioned and in the absence of a standby horizon, for which there was no airworthiness requirement, there was no single instrument available for assured attitude reference or simple means of determining which flight instruments had failed. The pilot became spatially disoriented and was unable to maintain control."

While the captain continued the descent the co-pilot carried out the landing gear alternate extension checklist. The plane descended below the minimum safe step-down altitudes for the approach and struck the top of a ridge line. The captain did not ensure the aircraft intercepted and maintained the approach profile during the non-precision instrument approach. The captain's  unwise decision to get the landing gear lowered without discontinuing the instrument approach. The captain's distraction from the primary task of flying the aircraft safely during the first officer's attempt  to correct a landing gear malfunction."

El Deluvio 38 miles north of Cali while attempting to land. On approach, the crew was requested to report over Tulua VOR which they already passed. This confused them and they decided to go direct to Rozo beacon. Entering the abbreviation ""R"", incorrectly steered the plane towards Bogota. More than a minute into the  turn the crew steered manually toward Cali, but this now took them into the path of a mountain. Crew error. Lack of situational awareness, failure to adequately plan and execute the approach, failure to realize that the FMS had turned the aircraft toward mountains. Crew also neglected to retract the speed brakes after the Ground Proximity Warning System alert.  Lack of adequate radar. Different  Flight Management System naming convention from that published in navigational charts."
