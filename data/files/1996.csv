The NTSB determined that the probable cause of the accident was an explosion of the center wing fuel tank resulting from ignition of the flammable fuel/air mixture in the tank. The source of ignition energy for the explosion could not be determined with certainty but, of the sources evaluated by the investigation, the most likely was a short circuit outside of the center wing tank that allowed excessive voltage to enter it through electrical wiring associated with the fuel quantity indication system.  To say that numerous government agencies acted strangely and suspiciously would be an understatement.  A great deal of evidence was either suppressed or ignored. Rumors persist that the plane was brought down by a missile, either by the Navy conducting exercises in the area or by terrorists."

The pilot tried to return to the airport for an emergency landing but the right wing seperated and the plane crashed. Fatigue failure of the master connecting rod, which originated from corrosion pitting, subsequently compromised the engine crankcase, and resulted in a fire; and failure of the flight crew to follow emergency procedures by pulling the fire handle before feathering the propeller, which diminished the effectiveness of the fire suppression system."

For unknown reasons, a decision was made to overshoot even though insufficient runway remained for acceleration, take-off, and climb. Likely contributing directly to the decision to overshoot was the difficulty in controlling the aircraft on touchdown."

The crew did not use the usual approach which includes a turn over the ocean, but rather took a route that led through a narrow valley. Inadequate planning, unsatisfactory crew resource management and monitoring, not discontinuing the approach when procedural uncertainties existed and limited knowledge of the operating language and the actual airspace. The passengers were mainly Russian coal miners headed for a Russian mine on one of the Norwegian islands."

The prop was feathered.  Soon after, a part of the feathering mechanism failed and the prop started windmilling causing drag. The aircraft rapidly descended and crashed onto a mud-flat. The accident was initiated by a combined failure of the left engine and the left feathering system. The accident became inevitable when the flight crew allowed the speed to decrease below stall speed and lost control of the aircraft at an altitude from which recovery was not possible."

He later informed ATC he could not feather the propeller. The  aircraft subsequently crashed and burned in a field.  The accident was due to inappropriate management of the flight following jamming of the propeller in an intermediate position after the right engine crankshaft ruptured. The inappropriate management was due to the pilot’s relative lack of experience on this aircraft type, his false notions about the aircraft’s performance and about the existence of a flight level to maintain level flight with an unfeathered propeller and an heavy aircraft and a series of misjudged strategies to attempt to continue the flight then to land at Limoges when the aircraft’s altitude no longer made this possible."

Meanwhile, the IL76, which was inbound to Delhi on the same airway, had been cleared to descend to FL150. However, due to a misunderstanding, the pilot and most of the cockpit crew of the IL76 believed the flight had been cleared to continue down to FL140. The Indian accident report attributed the failure of most of the IL76 crew to correctly understand the situation due to their lack of a working knowledge of English. Also contributing to the crew's decision to continue the descent below their clearance limit were poor cockpit resource management, a lack of leadership by the captain, a lack of co-ordination between the crew and a general casual attitude to the conduct of the flight."

The plane eventually ran out of fuel and ditched 500 feet offshore of Le Galawa Beach on the island of Grand Comoros. When it was aparent the plane was out of fuel, the hijackers fought the pilot for control of the aircraft. In the last seconds aloft, the left wing tip struck the water and the plane crashed into the sea flipping at least once before breaking into several  parts. The water was shallow but many passengers had inflated their safety vests which prevented them from swimming out from under the cabin and they drowned."

Factors included the captain's misreading of the instrument approach procedure, the crew's rushed and incomplete instrument approach briefing, their failure to use additional, available navigational aids, and their failure to account for the winds at altitude."
