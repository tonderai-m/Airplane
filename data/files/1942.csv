Potosi (Double Up Peak, Table Spring Mountain, Olcott Mountain), 32 miles SW of Las Vegas, NV, 15 minutes after taking off from the Western Airlines terminal building at Las Vegas. The aircraft clipped a rocky ledge, cartwheeled into the face of a cliff and exploded, scattering wreckage at the bottom of a ravine. Actress Carole Lombard, 33, her mother, and press agent  were killed in the crash. Her mother did not want to fly and a coin was tossed to see whether the trip would be made by train or plane. The actress was returning from a war-bond promotion.  The flight was 6.7 miles off course for unknown reasons.  Failure of the captain to follow a proper course and make use of navigation facilities available to him. A contributing factor was the blackout of beacons in the area made necessary because of the war emergency."

2127,"Pine Creek, Australia",Guinea Airways Limited,?,Brisbane - Bachelor Field,Lockheed 14 Electra,VH-ADY,?,12   (passengers:10  crew:2),12   (passengers:10  crew:2),0,"The aircraft was on a government charter carrying US teletype operators from a course they'd completed in Brisbane. They departed Archerfield (Brisbane) at 0622 EST and refuelled at Charleville, Cloncurry, and Daily Waters, departing from Daily Waters at 1655 Central Standard time. From there a chain of events happened and they remained lost in scattered thunderstorms and drizzle and the blacked out North, being told by Darwin D/F that they were over a hundred miles north of where they really were, due to the inadequacies of the equipment at that time of day, the storms and long distance. In an attempt to force land before running out of fuel, they probably had an engine failure from fuel starvation in the lower engine as they oozed around in a slow turn where the captain would have been peering forward out of an open window, trying to locate a lighter (more grassy) spot in the bush to put down in rain. They probably would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top. The wreckage was found on 6/22/1943.


We feel that they would have been very slow so as to descend rapidly when a likely spot was sighted and on increasing power on the remaining engine the Electra flipped into a vertical bank and struck a ridge top as one wing was undamaged and removed from the site when it was found.

Lockheed 14s were renown as nasty buggers at low speed on one engine."
