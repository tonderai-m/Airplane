The aircraft crashed into the Mediterranean Sea approximately 175 miles off the Egyptian coast. Two days after the accident, it is confirmed that ACARS messages reported smoke on board, apparently in the lavatory and also in a technical compartment located under the cockpit.The most likely cause was that a fire broke out in the cockpit while the aircraft was flying at its cruise altitude and that the fire spread rapidly resulting in the loss of control of the aircraft.",66,66,EgyptAir,
