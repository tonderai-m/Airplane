Faulty air starter unit. Crew took off ignoring the ""starter warning light"" thinking it was false.  The crew underestimated the severity of the situation due to shortcomings in the operational documentation.  Breakup of the No.2 engine starter, damaging fuel and oil lines and causing a fire."
"January 07, 1994",2321,"Columbus, Ohio",Atlantic Coast Airlines (United Express),6291,"Washington D.C. - Columbus, OH",British Aerospace Jetstream 4101,N304UE,41016,8   (passengers:3  crew:5),5   (passengers:2  crew:3),0,"The aircraft stalled 1.2 miles east of runway 28L during an ILS approach. An aerodynamic stall occurred when the flightcrew allowed the airspeed to decay to stall speed following a poorly planned and executed approach characterized by an absence of procedural discipline. Improper pilot response to the stall warning including failure to advance the power levers to maximum and inappropriately raising the flaps. Flightcrew's inexperience in a  ""glass cockpit"" automated aircraft."

Multiple engine failures occurred as a result of flight in extreme icing conditions. Incomplete performance of the emergency drills by the crew, as a result of not referring to the Emergency Checklist, prejudiced the chances of successful engine re-starts. Crew actions for securing and re-starting the failed engines, which were not in accordance with the operator's procedures, limited the power available. The drag from two unfeathered propellers of the failed engines and the weight of the heavily iced airframe resulted in a loss of height and control before the chosen diversion airfield could be reached. Poor Crew Resource Management reduced the potential for emergency planning, decision making and workload sharing. Consequently, the crew had no contingency plan for the avoidance of the forecast severe icing conditions, and also was unaware of the relative position of a closer diversion airfield which could have been chosen by making more effective use of air traffic services."

The pilot's 11 year old daughter and 16 year old son were taking turns in the pilot's seat. While the boy was flying, he inadvertently disengaged the autopilot linkage to the ailerons and put the airliner in a bank of 90 degrees which caused the nose to drop sharply. The co-pilot pulled back on the yoke to obtain level flight but the plane stalled. With his seat pulled all the way back, the co-pilot in the right hand seat could not properly control the aircraft. After several stalls and rapid pull-ups the plane went into a spiral descent. In the end the co-pilot initiated a 4.8g pull-up and nearly regained a stable flight path but the aircraft struck the ground in an almost level attitude killing all aboard. The aircraft was named Glinka, after Mikhail Glinka, the father of Russian music."

The ingestion of foreign material (snow) in the engine, which resulted in a flameout (loss of engine power). Factors related to the accident were: the adverse weather conditions (snow falling & high density altitude), the lack of snow covers to protect the engine intakes while parked and awaiting for the weather conditions to improve, improper planning/decision by the pilot and the company/operator management, inadequate information in the flight manual, and the lack of suitable terrain for an emergency landing."

While attempting to land, the aircraft rolled to the right, pitched up, stalled and crashed. Inadequate use of the flight controls during an asymmetric go-around resulting in loss of control. Contributing factors were insufficient understanding of the flightcrew of the SAAB 340B engine oil system, lack of awareness of the consequences of an aircraft configuration with one engine in flight idle and poor crew resource management."

The crew tried to override this situation by turning off the autothrottle and reducing air speed. The aircraft stalled, hit the runway tail first and burst into flames. The plane crashed because of an extreme out of trim configuration brought about by the fact that the tailplane setting had moved automatically and undetected to a maximum nose-up position. The plane climbed at a steep angle until it stalled. The crew could have saved the aircraft even in the final seconds had they reverted to basic flight procedures and switched off the autopilot."

The accident was caused by a loss of control of the aircraft resulting from the movement of the rudder surface to its blowdown limit or an uncommanded rudder reversal. The rudder surface deflected in a direction opposite to that commanded by the pilots as a result of a jam of the main rudder PCU servo valve secondary slide to the servo valve housing offset from its neutral position and overtravel of the  primary slide. The most likely sequence of events that led up to the accident included the jamming of the PCU servo valve, the application of light left rudder followed by hard right rudder which caused the rudder to reverse in the opposite direction the pilot commanded it to go.  The application of hard right rudder was possibly initiated because the plane flew into the wake vortex of a B-727 which rolled the plane to the left.  Rudder hardover is normally corrected with the stick (ailerons) but because the plane was flying at the crossover speed of 190 knots with flaps 1, using the stick would not correct the situation. When the right rudder was applied the rudder went to its fullblown left position causing the plane to roll further left, stall and go into a dive. Some speculate if the pilot-in-command pushed forward on the yoke to gain some speed rather than pull back, the accident possibly could have been avoided. Blame was not placed on the crew because there was no mention of this type of recovery by the manufacturer nor was there any training for such an occurrence."

Icing. The design of the rubber de-icing boot was insufficient to deal with icing on the wings. Sudden and unexpected aileron hinge movement reversal, that occurred after a ridge of ice accreted beyond the deice boots while the airplane was in a holding pattern during which it intermittently encountered supercooled cloud and drizzle/rain drops, the size and water content of which exceeded those described in the icing certificication envelope. The airplane was susceptible to this loss of control and the crew was unable to recover. Contributing factor was the French Directorate General for Civil Aviation's inadequate oversight of the ATR42 and ATR 72, and its failure to take the necessary corrective action to ensure continued airworthiness in icing conditions and failure to provide the FAA with timely airworthiness information developed from previous ATR incidents and accidents in icing conditions."
