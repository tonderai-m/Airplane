The weather at the time of the accident was freezing fog. The probablle cause of the accident was the missing control of the crew over the aircraft position in relation to the glideslope during the automatic approach, conducted at night in the weather conditions, suitable for ICAO CAT II landing, and as a result, the measures to perform a go-around, not taken in due time with the aircraft, having a significant deviation from the established approach chart, which led to the controlled flight impact with terrain at the distance of 930 m beyond the end of the active runway."
"February 21, 2017",0900,"Melbourne, Victoria, Australia",Australian Corporate Jet Centres PTY. LTD,?,Melbournen - King Island,Beechcraft B200 Super King Air,VH-ZCR,BB1544,5   (passengers:4  crew:1),5   (passengers:4  crew:1),0,"The charter flight was just seconds into it's flight when it was observed flying low, before it nose diving into a building at a shopping center and bursting into flames. The pilot made two mayday calls before the aircraft crashed. The aircraft's rudder trim was likely in the full nose-left position at the commencement of the take-off.
 The aircraft's full nose-left rudder trim setting was not detected by the pilot prior to take-off. Following a longer than expected ground roll, the pilot took-off with full left rudder trim selected. This configuration adversely affected the aircraft's climb performance and controllability, resulting in a collision with terrain."
